<h2 class="blackpar_title"> AAAI 2023 Workshop on Artificial Intelligence for Operations Research </h2>
<!-- <h3 class="blackpar_title"> AAAI 2023 </h3> -->
</center>

Operations Research (OR) is an interdisciplinary field that employs advanced analytical methods to aid in decision-making. It leverages techniques from mathematics, statistics, and computer science to model and solve intricate problems, optimizing outcomes across various sectors such as business, government, healthcare, and engineering.

As OR evolves with the growing wave of digitization, it has become imperative to integrate Artificial Intelligence (AI) into the OR process.  Recognizing this crucial intersection, our workshop titled "Artificial Intelligence for Operations Research" intends to delve into the transformative potential of AI to reinvent the traditional OR process.

<!-- Call for Papers -->
<h2 class="blackpar_title" id="Call for Papers">Call for Papers</h2>

The traditional OR process begins with the identification and definition of the problem, including understanding its context, objectives, and regulations. Following this, data is collected from several sources like historical records, market research, or sensor readings, and is preprocessed to ensure its quality and relevance. The third step involves formulating a mathematical model that accurately captures the system's essential elements. Common mathematical models involve mixed integer linear programming, quadratic programming, and stochastic programming. The model is then optimized using various solution methods, such as heuristics, cut generation schemes, decomposition methods, interior point methods, and branch-and-bound to identify the best possible solution. The final step involves interpreting, validating the solution, and evaluating its effectiveness in meeting the requirements.

This workshop is designed to delve into the diverse avenues through which AI can bolster each part of the OR process. We kindly request that all submissions be rendered in PDF format. The entirety of the content, encompassing all tables and illustrations, should remain within a nine-page limit, with any supplementary pages being allocated solely for references.
Submissions are welcomed through [OpenReview submission portal](https://openreview.net/). Please follow the guidelines provided in the [AAAI 2023 Author Kit](https://www.aaai.org/Publications/Templates/AuthorKit23.zip).

Topics of interest for this workshop include, but are not limited to:

1. Predict-Then-Optimize Approaches
2. Large Language Models for OR Model Matching
3. Large Language Models for OR Model Formulation
4. Learning to Optimize
5. Deep Learning-Based Optimization Algorithms
6. Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive Optimization
7. AI and OR innovative applications
8. AI-based algorithm configuration
9. Integrating AI and OR for fair decisions



<h2 class="blackpar_title" id="Submission">Submission Instructions</h2>
You are invited to submit your papers in our <a href='https://www.softconf.com/emnlp2023/newsumm2023/'>START/SoftConf submission portal</a>. All the submitted papers have to be anonymous for double-blind review. The content of the paper should not be longer than 8 pages for long papers and 4 pages for short papers, strictly following the <a href='https://2023.aclweb.org/calls/main_conference/#paper-submission-policies'>ACL 2023 style templates</a>, with the mandatory limitation section not counting towards the page limit. Supplementary and appendices (either as separate files or appended after the main submission) are allowed. We encourage code link submissions for the camera-ready version.

NewSumm 2023 will allow double submission as long as the authors make a decision before camera-ready. We will not consider any paper that overlaps significantly in content or results with papers that will be (or have been) published elsewhere. Authors submitting more than one paper to NewSumm 2023 must ensure that their submissions do not overlap significantly (>25%) with each other in content or results. Authors can submit up to 100 MB of supplementary materials separately. Authors are highly encouraged to submit their codes for reproducibility purposes.
